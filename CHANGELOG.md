## [Unreleased]

...

## [1.2.0] - 2019-05-21

### Added
- Backport the `blocks.meter` namespace and logic from the 2.x series.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-12-24

This release upgrades the library to Clojure 1.9.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-11-05

Finally seems like time for a 1.0 release. One very minor breaking change.

### Added
- New predicate `blocks.core/lazy?`.

### Changed
- *BREAKING:* the `:stored-at` metadata on blocks is now returned as a
  `java.time.Instant` instead of a `java.util.Date`.
- `MemoryBlockStore` uses a ref internally instead of an atom.
- Minor dependency version upgrades.
- Generative block store tests are now based on `test.carly`.

### Removed
- *BREAKING:* Blocks no longer implement `IDeref` as a way to get their internal
  content.

## [0.9.1] - 2017-05-17

### Added
- `PersistentBytes` has a `toByteArray` method to return a copy of the byte data
  as a raw array.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-03-31

This release has a couple of breaking changes, detailed below.

### Added
- `PersistentBytes` values support comparison using lexical sorting rules.
- `blocks.core/->store` initializer function to create block stores from URI
  configuration strings.
- `blocks.core/scan` function to produce a summary of the blocks contained in
  the store.
- Summary data functions which provide a count, total size, size histogram, and
  bloom filter for block id membership.
- `blocks.core/sync!` function to copy blocks between stores.
- `ErasableStore` protocol for block stores which support efficient or atomic
  data removal. There's a matching `blocks.core/erase!!` function using it,
  which falls back to deleting the blocks in the store individually.
- Buffer store supports a maximum block size limit. Storing blocks larger than
  the limit will write directly to the backing store, skipping the buffer.

### Changed
- `blocks.store.util` namespace merged into `blocks.store`. This mainly impacts
  store implementers.
- Replica store construction changed to make them better components. They now
  take a vector of keys, rather than stores.

### Removed
- Dropped `EnumerableStore` protocol and `enumerate` method. No usages have
  come up requiring it and it's easy to replace in the non-optimized case.

## [0.8.0] - 2016-08-14

### Changed
- All block stores were renamed to consistently end with `BlockStore`.
- All block store constructors are similarly renamed, e.g. `file-block-store`.
- Store constructors all follow a component pattern with variadic options.
- Blocks no longer implement `IPending`, because it is not appropriate to treat
  immutable values as asynchronous references.

### Added
- Multimethod `blocks.store/initialize` for constructing block stores from a
  URI string. The method is dispatched by URI scheme.

### Removed
- Problematic namespace `blocks.data.conversions`, which defined conversion
  paths for the `byte-streams` library.


## [0.7.1] - 2016-07-25

### Fixed
- Small number of reflection warnings in `blocks.data/clean-block`.
- Improved generative store tests.

## [0.7.0] - 2016-04-27

### Changed
- Upgrade `mvxcvi/multihash` to 2.0.0.
- Small efficiency improvements to block construction.
- Memory stores strip metadata and extra attributes from blocks `put!` in them.
- Integration tests in `blocks.store.tests` now build generative sequences of
  operations and apply them to the store under test.

### Fixed
- Reading an empty content source returns `nil` instead of an empty block.
- Check that the argument to `block/put!` is actually a block.
- Handle block merging in `block/put!` instead of requiring stores to do it.
- File stores correctly return `false` when deleting a block which is not
  contained in the store.

## [0.6.1] - 2016-01-25

### Added
- Expand `PersistentBytes` equality to include primitive byte arrays and
  `ByteBuffer` objects which have identical content.

### Fixed
- `block/store!` will no longer try to store empty files.

## [0.6.0] - 2016-01-10

### Added
- Add logical 'replica' and 'buffer' stores.
  [#2](//github.com/greglook/blocks/issues/2)
- Add a second arity to `block/open` to read a sub-range of the content in a
  block by specifying starting and ending bytes.
  [#3](//github.com/greglook/blocks/issues/3)
- Add protocol for batch block operations.
  [#5](//github.com/greglook/blocks/issues/5)
- Add protocol for efficient block enumeration.
  [#8](//github.com/greglook/blocks/issues/8)

### Changed
- Remove extra 'Block' from many store record names, for example
  `FileBlockStore` to `FileStore`.
- Change file store to match IPFS file repo behavior by restricting it to a
  single intermediate directory level.
- Move block store protocols to `blocks.store` namespace, with wrappers in
  `blocks.core`.

### Fixed
- `validate!` now checks the size of lazy blocks by using a counting input
  stream wrapper.

## [0.5.0] - 2015-11-14

### Added
- `blocks.store.cache` namespace with logical caching block store
  implementation.

### Changed
- `random-bytes` and `random-hex` now generate fixed-width data.

## [0.4.2] - 2015-11-13

### Changed
- File store now locks itself during `put!`, `delete!`, and `erase!` to
  prevent concurrent modifications.
- `select-stats` moved from core to util namespace.

### Fixed
- File store skips over malformed files instead of throwing an exception.

## [0.4.1] - 2015-11-12

### Changed
- Rename `:origin` block stat to `:source`.
- Switch argument order in `read-block` for consistency.

### Fixed
- `put!` retains extra attributes and metadata on the block argument in the
  returned block.
- Expanded integration test suite to cover `stat` and `get` on non-existent
  blocks and `put!` merging.

## [0.4.0] - 2015-11-10

Lots of high-level library changes! `blocks.data.Block` is now a custom type to
protect immutable fields like `:id` and `:size` and support the `IPending`
interface.

### Added
- Blocks can be either _literal_ or _lazy_ to support larger block sizes.
- A standard set of BlockStore integration tests are available in the
  `blocks.store.tests` namespace.

### Changed
- `BlockStore` methods `enumerate` and `get*` changed to `-list` and `-get`,
  respectively.
- `list` now returns a sequence of block stats, rather than just multihashes.
- Blocks returned by `get` and `put!` add stat information as metadata.
- File stores now keep blocks in a manner compatible with IPFS.

## 0.3.0 - 2015-11-03
