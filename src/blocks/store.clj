    "List the blocks contained in the store. This method should return a stream
    of blocks ordered by multihash id. See `blocks.core/list` for the supported
    options.

    The method must return _at least_ the blocks which match the query options,
    and _should_ optimize the results by omitting unmatched blocks. The
    returned stream may be closed preemptively if the consumer is done, which
    should terminate the list thread.

    If the listing thread encounters an exception, the error should be placed
    on the stream and the stream should be closed to indicate no further blocks
    will be coming. Consumers must handle exceptions propagated on the stream.")

    yields a map with block information but no content, or nil if the store
    does not contain the identified block.")

    or nil if not present.")

    stored block, which may have already been present in the store.")

    block was stored, false if it was not."))

  "An erasable store has some notion of being removed in its entirety, often
  atomically. For example, a file system might unlink the root directory rather
  than deleting each individual file."
