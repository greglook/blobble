  "Block storage API. Functions which may cause IO to occur are marked with
  bangs.

  For example `(read! \"foo\")` doesn't have side-effects, but `(read!

  about the blocks, including:

  - `:source`      resource location for the block content
  - `:stored-at`   time block was added to the store
