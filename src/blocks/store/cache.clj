(ns blocks.store.cache
  "Cache stores provide logical block storage backed by two other stores, a
  _primary store_ and a _cache_. Blocks are added to the cache on reads and
  writes, and evicted with a least-recently-used strategy to keep the cache
  under a certain total size. Operations on this store will prefer to look up
  blocks in the cache, and fall back to the primary store when not available.

  Because the caching logic runs locally, the backing cache storage should not
  be shared among multiple concurrent processes."
